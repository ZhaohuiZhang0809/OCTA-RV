The newly proposed OCTA-RetinaVessel dataset contains 62 OCTA images that have been professionally labeled at the pixel level, as shown in Fig, and each image is labeled down to the 1-mm pixel level, which focuses more on the labeling of microvessels compared with the OCTA500 dataset, and the OCTA-RetinaVessel dataset additionally includes images such as choroidal neovascularization (CNV), retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), retinal artery occlusion (BRVO), and other retinal vascular lesion samples, which is of great significance for the study of microvascular lesions.
